Random-Password
===============

Create a random password with this simple ruby script!

I have to change my password every month at work with lots of requirements.  3 unique characters of each of the following:
numbers, capital letters, lowercase letters, and special characters.  To solve this headache I wrote this small script so
I could quickly and easily generate a new password.  

I added a little customization so that if you have certain requirements you can enter them as well.
